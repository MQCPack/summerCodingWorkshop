## Step-by-step Process for Solving This Problem

- [ ] Look up and review the 1D particle-in-a-box.
- [ ] Derive algebraic expression for kinetic energy matrix elements.
- [ ] Derive algebraic expression for potential energy matrix elements.
- [ ] Code a problem that accepts (at the command line) the particle mass, box width, the bra quantum number, and ket quantum number and returns the kinetic energy integral element.
  - **HINT:** Note that the PIB eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy operator as well.
- [ ] Modify the code from the last checkbox to also return the potential matrix element.
